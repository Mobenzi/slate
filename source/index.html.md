# Introduction

Welcome to the Mobenzi Outreach API! You can use our API to access Kittn API endpoints, which can get information on various cats, kittens, and breeds in our database.

Outreach is a tool designed to help quickly and easily configure mini databases, create workflows and adhoc c# scripts as well as exploit the override and trigger mechanisms built into the Mobenzi researcher platform.
